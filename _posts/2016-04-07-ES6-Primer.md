title: ES6 primer for getting started with Angular
---

ECMAScript is the name of the standard that guides Javascript.

ES6 stands for ECMAScript 6 the latest version of the standard finalized in 2015.

This is the latest version of Javascript and has significantly new features aimed at helping develop and maintain large
scale web applications.

While this new version of Javascript doesn't enjoy as much browser support as it's predecessor it's possible to compile
ES6 code into ES6 using tools like [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)

Angular 2 in particular makes a lot of use from these features, so if you are planing to get into Angular 2 development
it's a good idea to learn at least some of the features in ES6.

So lets get started!

#### Variable Declaration

##### let

There's a new keyword that let's you declare variables in Javascript named `let`. If you recall using `var` would cause
the variables declared to be [hoisted](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_hoisting.asp). Variables declared using the `let`
keyword are not hoisted and behave in the way most of us would expect.

```javascript
function productAvailability(item) {
    if (item.quantity > 0) {
        let availability = item.quantity + "is Available"
        return availability;
    }
    // availability is not accessible here
    // if we used var to declare availability it will be available here due to hosting.

    return "Out of stock!";
}
```

#### const

With ES6 there is now a way to declare actual constants, using the const keyword.

```javascript
const PI = 3.14159;
//PI cannot be reassigned
//PI has to be assigned a value at declaration time.
```

However this constant only makes the variable constant, if you declare a object a constant, you can change it's
properties but you cannot point the variable at another object.

```javascript
const CAR = {make:"Toyota", model:"Prius"};

CAR.model = "AQUA"; //This is legal and valid

CAR = {make:"Nissan", model:"Cefiro"}; //This is invalid and illegal
```

The new `const` keyword behaves in a similar manner to Java's `final` keyword.

#### Default parameters

ES6 now has defauolt parameters built in. No more `||` logic asigning default values inside functions!

Syntax is pretty simple

```javascript
function foo(param1 = 0, param2 = calculateDefaultValue()){

}
```

#### Object creation and variable assignment

You can use a shortcut to create objects in ES6.

```javascript
function createCar(){
    let make = "Toyota";
    let model = "Camry";

    return {make, model}; //Previously you had to name them like {make:make, model:model}
}
```

There are ways we can make assignments from objects to variables shorter as well.

```javascript
let car = {make:"Toyota", model:"aqua", modelDetails:{year:2010,engineCapacity:"2.4l"}}

//This is how you'd do the assignment traditionally
let carMake = car.make;
let carModel = car.model;

//Now we can use this shortcut
let {carMake:make, carModel:model} = car;

// If your variable names are the same as the object attributes you can write
let {make,model} = car;
//Now you have two variables name make and model populated with the car objects properties named the same.

//You can make nested assignments as well.
let {modelDetails : {year}} = car;
//Now you have a variable named year with the car.modelDetails.year property assigned to it.

//Array element assignment is also possible in order.
let manufacturedYears = ["2009","2010","2011","2012"];
let [year1,year2] = manufacturedYears;
//year1 has a value of 2009, year2 has a value of 2010
```

#### Variable arguments

Many languages have clear and obvious support for variable arguments.

With ES6 specification, javascript does too.

Previously you had to use the `arguments` variable to get extra arguments passed to a function. But this wasn't very
visible or readable.

Now we can use `...` operator to pass variable arguments in a more visible way.

```javascript
function addCars(...cars){
    for(let car in cars){
        carsInFactory.add(car);
    }
}
```

The `...` operator is called the rest operator and can be used in variable assignments as well
```javascript
let manufacturedYears = ["2009","2010","2011","2012"];

let [firstYear, ...allOtherYears] = manufacturedYears;
//firstYear will have a value of 2009 and the allOtherYears will have the elements from 2010 onwards
```

#### String templates

One of the most annoying things to do in javascript is putting together strings. We had to use concatenation to
compose a string. Not anymore.

Now you can do string templating using the **``** operator like this.

```javascript
let fullName = `Mr. ${firstName} ${lastName}`;

//Clean Multiline support is available as well. This will help immensely with writing markup.
let welcomeMarkup = `<div>
    <h1>Welcome ${firstName} </h1>
</div>
`
```
