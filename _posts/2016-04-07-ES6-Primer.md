title: ES6 primer for getting started with Angular
---

ECMAScript is the name of the standard that guides Javascript.

ES6 stands for ECMAScript 6 the latest version of the standard finalized in 2015.

This is the latest version of Javascript and has significantly new features aimed at helping develop and maintain large
scale web applications.

While this new version of Javascript doesn't enjoy as much browser support as it's predecessor it's possible to compile
ES6 code into ES6 using tools like [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)

Angular 2 in particular makes a lot of use from these features, so if you are planing to get into Angular 2 development
it's a good idea to learn at least some of the features in ES6.

So lets get started!

the variables declared to be [hoisted](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_hoisting.asp)
