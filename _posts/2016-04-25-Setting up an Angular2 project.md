title: How to setup an Angular 2 project with Typescript support.
---

There are two ways to create an Angular 2 project.

One is to use ES6, the other is to use Typescript. Typescript offers strong types and a cleaner way to configure
Angular 2 components called `decorators`.

Personally I prefer using typescript. It ticks all the right boxes for me, being from a Java backend. And using
`decorators` for configuring the angular metadata is similar to what I've done with Java annotations.
