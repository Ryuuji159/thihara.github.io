### More Information

I'm From Sri Lanka, a beautiful country, famous for it's tea and culture.

Been working mainly on the Java stack for web and enterprise applications.

Recently I've been working with Groovy and grails and at the moment looking at the influx of
Javascript.

Favorite IDEs are make by Jetbrains.

Personality wise I'm pretty laid back and likes to have fun, even though my sense of humour isn't for
everyone.

I enjoy helping and mentoring others.

I like to learn, and I believe working with smarter, considerate people is the best way. I also
like reading fiction and playing video games, I find them to be stimulating apart from being fun.

Spend any free time I have (after gaming) to contribute to stackoverflow.
